;; I wrote this because I was keeping my cycling log as a text file in	
;; emacs.  I want to do a few simple things like total up the number	
;; of miles or number of hours I've ridden, but a full-blown		
;; spreadsheet seems like overkill for this.  So I defined a simple	
;; mark-up that instructs emacs to sum up the numbers in a certain	
;; rectangle.  I also wanted to create sub-totals which were then	
;; added together to produce a grand total, so there's also a facility	
;; for adding up all of the subtotals matching some regexp.            	
;;                                                                      
;; I call this "Electric Forms Mode" because it functions sort of like	
;; a web form where you fill in a few numbers and then they get		
;; crunched into some sort of result, but the format is not so rigid	
;; as a spreadsheet.                                                    
;;
;; To install, you'll probably want this in your .emacs file:
;; (require 'eform)
;; And you might want something like this:
;; (global-set-key "\C-cu" (lambda () (interactive) (eform-mode t) (eform-update)))
;;
;; I'll explain the format with an example.  You have a file that
;; looks like this (without the semicolons):
;;
;;     (#dist-jan  (#time-jan
;; 1-1   11.1         0:38
;; 1-2   15.3         1:01 
;; 1-3    5.5         0:25
;;     #dist-jan)   #time-jan)
;;
;;     (#dist-feb  (#time-feb
;; 2-1   11.0         0:37
;; 2-2   15.2         1:00 
;; 2-3    5.4         0:24
;;     #dist-feb)   #time-feb)
;;
;; SUBTOTALS
;; #dist-jan ()
;; #time-jan fhm + thm ()
;; #dist-feb ()
;; #time-feb fhm + thm ()
;;
;; GRAND TOTALS
;; (dist-.*) #total-dist ()
;; (time-.*) #total-time ()
;;
;; 
;; So, # identifies all the places where something interesting is
;; going to happen.  The (#name and #name) tags denote the beginning
;; and ending of rectangles that will be summed up.  #name ()
;; indicates where the result will go.  So, when you invoke enable
;; eform-mode and then invoke eform-update, this code will sum up all
;; the numbers in the rectangles demarcated by (#dist-jan and
;; #dist-jan) and then stick the result between the parenthesis on the
;; line #dist-jan ().
;;
;; Consider the case of times.  I don't want to have to type in the
;; length of my rides using only minutes (ie, 90 minutes instead of
;; 1:30).  Therefore you can specify a mapping function, a
;; reduction function, and a post-processing function on the line that
;; will hold the result of a computation.  These are fhm, +, and thm
;; above.  fhm takes a string of the form "hour:min" and converts it
;; to an integer number of minutes.  The function + is then used as a
;; binary "reduction" operator to combine all of the resulting
;; integers.  Finally thm is applied to the result.  It takes an
;; integer number of minutes and converts it to a string of the form
;; "hour:minute" which will be inserted back into the buffer between
;; the parenthesis on the "result" line #time-jan fhm + thm ()
;;
;; Note that these functions under discussion are just plain old elisp
;; functions looked up by name.  So you can easily write your own
;; functions to massage your data as needed.
;; 
;; You don't have to specify all of the the map, reduction, and post
;; functions.  They default to string-to-number, +, and
;; number-to-string, respectively.  If you specify one, two, or three
;; function, then eform-mode takes a guess about what you mean as
;; follows: 
;; #name reduction () 
;; #name map reduction () 
;; #name map reduction post () 
;; ie, first you override the reduction function,
;; then the mapping function, and finally the postprocessing
;; function.
;;
;; There's actually a fourth function you can specify which is a
;; preprocessing function.  It gets a crack at transforming the data
;; before anything else sees it.  This lets you write this:
;;
;; (#name 1 2 3 4 #name) 
;; #name split string-to-number * number-to-string ()
;; 
;; Ie, all the data is on one line instead of being on separate lines.
;; The function split is defined below and it simply splits up the
;; data so that the other functions can do their work.  Here 24 will
;; appear between the parenthesis.
;;
;; To summarize:
;; Function     Arg type          Result type   Default
;; preprocess   list of strings   list of A     identity
;; mapping      A                 B             string-to-number
;; reduction    B,B               C             +
;; postprocess  C                 string        number-to-string
;;
;; where A, B, and C are any types.
;;
;; Now, there's one final form of "result" line that lets you take the
;; results of previous calculations and use them somehow.  These are
;; the total-dist and total-time lines in the example above.  The set
;; of parenthesis on the left holds a regexp and the meaning of the
;; line is "Look for all previous computations in the buffer with a
;; name matching regexp and operate on those results."  Everything
;; else is the same as the "rectangle" style of data input--you can
;; specify up to four functions, etc.
;;
;; Now the documentation is getting as long as the code, so I'll stop.
;;
;; If you actually get any use out of this, e-mail me.  Suggestions
;; are welcome.  This is my first crack at elisp, though, so be kind.  
;; 
;; To Do list for Version 2:
;; 1) recalc until buffer stops changing.
;; 2) use buffer local lisp variables for results of computations?
;; 3) Figure out how to exclude open/close characters from .* regexp in result field
;; 4) Clear all results function
;; 5) Bug when total-d-dec starts with a d..
;; 6) Bug when rectangle has "destination" but no "source"
