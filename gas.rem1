Hi <speakername>,
This is to remind you that you're scheduled to give a GAS on <date>, a week from today.  Please let me know what you're going to talk about if you haven't already so that I can include it in the reminders I'll send out.  You can check out http://www.ucolick.org/~novak/Gas for information on the subjects of recent GAS's.

We have ISB 356 reserved from 12:30-1:30pm on Monday, but don't feel pressured to fill up the hour.  Almost any length of time is fine.  If you're looking for a topic, it can be a journal-club style talk on a recent paper or a classic paper, a talk on your own research, or even a talk on something interesting but unrelated to Astronomy.  The only requirement is that you find the topic cool and interesting.

Thanks,
Greg
